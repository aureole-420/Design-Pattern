Welcome to the Ball World, where you will meet a multitude of cool balls! 
These balls are lovely little creatures, with unique appearance and movement behavior. 
Watching them moving gives visual as well as spiritual pleasure. Have fun!

Instructions:
1. Run src/controller/BallWorldController.java to launch the application.
2. On the control panel
	* Input the name of your desired ball, e.g., model.ball.ButterflyBall in the text field
	* Then click "Load new ball" to summon a ball of your desired type. You can continuously click the button several times to summon multiple balls.
	* Click "Clear balls" to remove all balls.
3. There are at least five different types of balls, namely
	* model.ball.NormalBall -- balls that move along straight lines.
	* model.ball.BreathingBall -- balls which change their size all the time
	* model.ball.ButterflyBall -- balls which change their color all the time (shining like butterfly :P)
	* model.ball.CurvingBall -- balls rotating (and may also taking translational movement at the same time.)
	* model.ball.DrunkenBall -- balls which try to move along straight line but could help to change direction every several steps -- poor little guy.
	
	They are sure many other types of balls. Let me know if you find/discover/cultivate new species!
