 * Abstract class that provides defaut behavior for subclasses that will decorate another

 * delegate to the decoree. A subclass should override one or more methods, adding additional processing either before or after
 * delegating to the decoree. Note that this class cannot be used by the BallWorld System directly as it
 * lacks a no-parameter constructor.
