Instructions:
	1. Open the project in Eclipse and run src/controller/BallWorldController.java

Options:
	1. Add an UpdateStrategy to the drop list and select one.
		Input class name into the textfield and click "Add to lists". It will add a new strategy to the drop list.
		
		Available update strategies are as below:
		* Ordinary strategies with no interaction
			* Breathing - ball will changes its radius
			* Brownian  - ball moves in Brownian motion
			* Color - ball changes random color after a constant period
			* Curving - ball moves in curve motion
			* Drunken - ball changes to a random velocity after constant time period
			* FadeOut - ball fades out after a random period, and repeating
			* Ninja - ball will vanish for a while 
			* Straight - regular straight ball
		* Strategies that interact when balls overlap:
			* Infect -- A black-colored infected ball that will turn any other ball it overlaps with into an Infect ball for its first 100 updates. All infected ball
					can be cured (turn green) after 100 updates of infection, though they may get infection again.
			* Spawn -- adds an identical ball whenever it overlaps with another ball.
		* Strategies that both collide and interact:
			* Collide - elastic collision behavior.
		* Strategies that just detect an interaction and invoke the interaction strategies of the interacting balls.
			* Overlap -- Detects if the ball overlaps with any other balls.
			* Realm -- Detects if any ball enter the realm (radius of 100) of the context ball.
		* Strategies that only install interaction strategies and thus at least be combined with a strategy that detects an interaction, e.g. Overlap, Realm or Collide.
			* Kill -- deletes other when it collides. 
			* Collide2 -- elastic collision implemented purely as an interaction strategy.   Combine with Overlap to see bouncing balls.
			* Enlarge -- enlarge the size of target ball(s) implemented purely as an interaction strategy. Combine with Overlap/Collide/Realm.
			* Accelerate -- increasing velocity of target ball(s) implemented purely as an interaction strategy. Combine with Overlap/Collide/Realm.
			* Assimilate -- Assimilate target ball(s) implemented purely as an interaction strategy. Combine with Overlap/Collide/Realm.
			* Friction -- reducing velocity of target ball(s) implemented purely as an interaction strategy. Combine with Overlap/Collide/Realm.
		
		
		Note: A Straight ball will appear with beeping if the class name you input doesn't match any class of update strategy. And it's case-sensitive.
	
	2. Add a PaintStrategy to the drop list and select one:
		Input class name into the text field and click "Add". A new paint strategy will be added to the drop list.
		
		Available pait strategies are listed below:
		a) Ball - a ball
		b) Square - a square 
		c) Rectangle - a rectangle
		d) Ellipse - an ellipse
		e) Fish1 - a fish with mouth open
		f) Fish2 - a fish with mouth closed
		g) SwimFish - a fish keep opening and closing mouth while swimming 
		h) Nice Fish - an upright SwimFish with black eye
		i) BirdSheepImage - bird or sheep
		j) GhostImage - an rotating ghost
		
		* A straight ball will appear with beeping if the classname you input doesn't match any class of paint strategy. And it's case-sensitive.
		
	2. Make Selected Balls: 
		Click "Make Selected Balls", and the ball with strategy selected in the upper drop list will be created.
	
	3. Combine Strategies:
		Select TWO strategies from top and bottom drop lists, and click "Combine!" will create a new combined strategies into the drop lists.
		
	4. Make Switcher
		Click "Make Switcher" to make a Switcher ball in the canvas. Switch ball is a straight ball by default, until user at least switch its strategy once.
		
	5. Switch the strategy of Switchers
		Click "Switch!", the strategy of Switchers will be swapped to the strategy selected in upper drop list. 
	 
	6. Clear All!
		Simply removes all the balls on the canvas
